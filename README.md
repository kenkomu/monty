Welcome to the Monty Bytecode Interpreter. This interpreter was built in the C language and is compliant with ISO90, ISO99, & ISO11. It reads Monty bytecode files of any extension (preferably .m although it doesn't matter), and interprets the opcodes contained.

Our interpreter can be run as either a stack (LIFO) or queue (FIFO). Mode can be switched mid-script. The interpreter can handle a variety of Monty opcodes, including printing, mathematical operations, and more.
